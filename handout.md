# The Vision For You --- Primary Texts

## Serenity Prayer

God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.

## The Vision For You Preamble

_The Vision for You_ is the name given to a process by which we, who have been through it, discovered our true calling in life --- what we call our _personal vocation_; and through which we discovered the _Great Fact:_ that we have a choice in life. We can choose to to be happy or to be miserable.

Our goal is to be happy and to become, more and more, the people we were meant to be. We aim to lead a life that is good, true and beautiful, on the Way of Beauty.

The purpose of these workshops is to present information about the Vision for You process and to provide a forum where those who have been through the process can meet and help those who have not.

When we tell our stories, we relate in general terms our experiences and communicate the source of our hope and strength. We describe what it used to be like, what we did so that things changed, and what life is like now.

If you decide you want to go through this process too, then we suggest strongly that you do so under the personal guidance of someone who has completed the first seven of our _Eight Principles for Progress_ and is working the eighth on a daily basis. We refer to that person as a **sponsor**.

## Eight Principles for Progress

This is what we did.

### I. Reflection --- the Three Acknowledgements

 1. We acknowledged that **we are the cause of our own unhappiness** through our self-centered behaviors, thoughts and feelings (otherwise known as sins). The cause is not other people or
circumstances, no matter how unfortunate.

 2. We acknowledged that **we are unable to control our thoughts and actions perfectly** or to rid ourselves of that unhappiness, which is in the form of resentment and fear.

 3. We acknowledged that **our sole hope for happiness is in God**. We set ourselves this ideal for living: with God’s grace we can do his will, be free of resentment and fear and have a good, beautiful and joyful life. Once we have accepted this truth, then we do have a choice and we can say that misery is optional.

### II. Action --- the Five Spiritual Exercises

 1. We adopted a **daily routine of prayer, reflection and good works**.

 2. When the daily routine had become habitual, we undertook a **detailed written self-examination**, looking at our past thoughts, feelings and behaviors in order to root out the resentments and fears arising from our self-centeredness. We admitted our shortcomings to God and to another trusted person.

 3. We **made amends for any harms done**, provided that to do so would not cause more harm.

 4. We **discerned our personal vocation** by consideration of what we would like to do in our wildest dreams, and then worked towards that goal.

 5. We **continued to deepen our spiritual lives** through the practice of a daily routine of prayer, reflection and good works.

## A Summary of the Daily Routine

We adopted this routine of prayer, reflection and good works until it became a habit of life.

### Prayer

 1. In the morning, on your knees in an action of humility, say something like: _Please God, take care of me today so that I can be of service to you and my fellows._

 2. In the evening before retiring, again on your knees say: _Thank you, God for looking after me._ --- It's good manners to say "Thank you."

 3. Reactive prayers during the day.
     a. If you are angry or annoyed at someone, pray for the person repeatedly until you feel better. For example: _Please give [the name of the person] everything that I would wish for myself._
     b. If you are fearful or anxious, say the _Serenity Prayer_ repeatedly until you feel better: _God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change; the courage to change the things I can; and the wisdom to know the difference._
     c. When you have been through the detailed self-examination as outlined in the spiritual exercises, apply this process to resentments and fears that crop up during the day as needed to remove them and to have a happy life.

### Personal Reflection

 1. Write a gratitude list and thank God for each blessing that you find.

 2. Spiritual reading. Read something each day that gives you an ideal to live by. For example, the _Just for Today_ statement.

### Good works

 1. We adopt a general attitude of seeking to be of service to others. We ask what we can give to the world, rather than what we can take.

 2. We make a regular voluntary sacrifice of time devoted to the service of others. For many of us this involved simply passing on this process to others by regular attendance at the _Vision for You_ workshops. And by sponsorship --- giving time to meet with others personally in order to take them through the process.

 3. We strove to "do the right thing." That is, to lead a good and virtuous life.

## The Lord's Prayer

_Prayed at the end of each meeting._

Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.  
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done  
on earth as it is in heaven.  
Give us this day our daily bread,  
and forgive us our trespasses,  
as we forgive those who trespass against us.  
Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.

For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,  
for ever and ever. Amen.

## Just For Today

_This may be read as part of your daily spiritual reading._

Just for today I will try to live through this day only, and not tackle all my problems at once. I can do something for twelve
hours that would appall me if I felt I had to keep it up for a lifetime.

Just for today I will be happy. Most folks are as happy as they
make up their minds to be.

Just for today I will adjust myself to what is, and not try to adjust everything to my own desires. I will take my “luck” as it comes, and fit myself to it.

Just for today I will try to strengthen my mind. I will study. I will learn something useful. I will not be a mental loafer. I will read something that requires effort, thought and concentration.

Just for today I will exercise my soul in three ways: I will do somebody a good turn, and not get found out; if anyone knows of it, it will not count. I will do at least two things I don’t want to do – just for exercise. I will not show anyone that my feelings are hurt; they may be hurt, but today I will not show it.

Just for today I will be agreeable. I will look as well as I can, dress becomingly, keep my voice low, be courteous, criticize not one bit. I won’t find fault with anything, nor try
to improve or regulate anybody but myself.

Just for today I will have a program. I may not follow it exactly, but I will have it. I will save myself from two pests: hurry and indecision.

Just for today I will have a quiet half hour all by myself and relax. During this half hour, sometime, I will try to get a better perspective of my life.

Just for today I will be unafraid. Especially I will not be afraid to notice what is beautiful and to believe that as I give to the world, so the world will give to me.
